# How to use #
Steps:
  1. Once a new tab is opened, there will be a **'helper'** area showing two buttons, **'add'** and **'delete'**. And there will be an input area that is showing the selected _div's_ id. The 'x' mark on the top right is a close button that can close itself. https://googledrive.com/host/0B-063CZNG9hsZGIySTNxeFdrb1k/helper.PNG
  1. Firstly, click somewhere in an area and the _div_ containing it would be changed **yellow** background. The color can be changed in options. https://googledrive.com/host/0B-063CZNG9hsZGIySTNxeFdrb1k/select.PNG
  1. If you want to merge that yellow area, you should click the  **'add'** button. And it would show the div's information as a list. https://googledrive.com/host/0B-063CZNG9hsZGIySTNxeFdrb1k/add.PNG
  1. If you ever click that area, but now you want to delete it, check the checkboxes and click **'delete'** button. And the selected divs will be deleted. Or you can delete all selected _divs_ in the popup window by clicking the button 'clear', which I will explain in the below steps. https://googledrive.com/host/0B-063CZNG9hsZGIySTNxeFdrb1k/delete1.PNG
  1. After you finished adding _divs_, you can click our extension's icon.  And then click **'Merge'**. ![https://googledrive.com/host/0B-063CZNG9hsZGIySTNxeFdrb1k/popup.png](https://googledrive.com/host/0B-063CZNG9hsZGIySTNxeFdrb1k/popup.png)
  1. All the above add,delete,merge operation can also be done by right click your mouse and find the PageMerger Menu. 'Result' represents 'merge' operation. ![https://googledrive.com/host/0B-063CZNG9hsZGIySTNxeFdrb1k/contextmenu.png](https://googledrive.com/host/0B-063CZNG9hsZGIySTNxeFdrb1k/contextmenu.png)
  1. A new tab would pop out showing your added _divs_ in one page.  https://googledrive.com/host/0B-063CZNG9hsZGIySTNxeFdrb1k/result.PNG You can click left or right button below the thumbnails to decide which side you want to put that div. Also you can add more than 2 _divs_ and it would show their thumbnails, but only two pages can be displayed at the same time. The old page can be replaced if you click a new page's 'left' or 'right' button. https://googledrive.com/host/0B-063CZNG9hsZGIySTNxeFdrb1k/replace.PNG
  1. You can also change the location of the two _divs_ in the result page by clicking the arrow in the right page. You can also click the question mark and it will pop up a window telling you the function of these buttons. https://googledrive.com/host/0B-063CZNG9hsZGIySTNxeFdrb1k/instruction.PNG

# Set options #
We have two preference options for color and the helper, which appears to the left-up part of the page.
You can choose color and choose to enable the helper.

After we do tests on various sites, we have found some websites don't like iframe, which makes our extension unusable. These websites are google and stackoverflow.
